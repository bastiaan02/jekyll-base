When locking an issue via the issues API, you can now provide an optional reason that will be visible to anyone who views the issue. Valid lock reasons are "off-topic", "too heated", "resolved", and "spam". Providing a lock reason can help make it clearer to contributors why an issue was locked, and what kinds of behavior may result in issues being locked in the future. This change will be available on both the REST API as well as the GraphQL API.
