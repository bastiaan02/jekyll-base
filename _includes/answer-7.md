### what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users ?

First and foremost the first challenge around DNS configuration for less-technical internet 
end-users is the ability to use dig, nslookup, host, ping, and other DNS querying tools for troubleshooting 
DNS settings. It can be very difficult to diagnose configuration issues without a good solid knowledge of these tools. 

Another challenge that comes to mind is Ease of Use. Open Source DNS solutions like BIND 
do not have native GUIs or robust API integrations, plus deploying and maintaining such a solution across 
your infrastructure is generally a complex process that is fraught with difficulty. But DNS like NS1 features
a simple and powerful single pane of glass user interface through which you can manage traffic across your
entire infrastructure. It is built on top of a clean and fully-featured RESTful API that speaks JSON to ensure
seamless integration.

DNS can get very technical. If you are not very technical, get a paid service that will do nearly everything automatically 
and make sure it has excellent technical support.
