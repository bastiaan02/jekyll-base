*Question 9:* A customer writes in saying their "site wonâ€™t build".  Compose your best
short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer without any additional data, that could be
useful in the generic case but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable
response.

Hi Scot,

I would need you to checkout this blog [post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/18/how-our-build-bots-build-sites/)

Please do not hesitate to get back to me if you are still unable to build your site after
applying the troubleshooting steps described in the above post, I would be happy to instruct
you further. Also If there is anything else you would need assistance with, do let me know,
