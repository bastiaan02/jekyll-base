*Question 6:*  Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product,
that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.  

The auth0 [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs) is just a joy to read through and easy to 
understand, I don't know whether it's my prior know of the auth0 architecture, but still 
the documentation is very well written in my opinion. First of all, you would notice the 
documentation works like an SPA, so page navigation is kind of smooth. While going through 
the documentation I notice how the documentation are very well linked to the relevant pages, 
plus it was easy for me to locate information with screenshot and code samples. Also checkout 
the [authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication) api section, notice the live
code example on the right of the page that shows up at specific intervals as you scroll from top
to bottom, pretty cool.
