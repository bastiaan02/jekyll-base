Hi Scot,  

Thanks for reaching out.

A lot of things could be going on to prevent a successful build of your site and the most 
common cause of this problem is when the versions of the build tools you are using on your 
local machine are different from the versions we are using. Here is an 
[article](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/18/how-our-build-bots-build-sites/) that talks 
about version conflicts and the build process in general that might be helpful for you.

To give you additional help, I’d love to learn more about your specific situation. 
What build tools are you using? Could you please attach a copy of the Deploy log for 
the failed build for me to review? You can get to the log report by going to the ``Deploys`` 
tab on your site dashboard and then click on the failed deploy.

Have an excellent day.
