*Question 8:* what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical 
internet end-users ?

First and foremost the first challenge around DNS configuration for less-technical internet
end-users is the ability to use dig, nslookup, host, ping and other DNS querying tools for troubleshooting
DNS settings.  Another challenge that comes to mind is "Ease of Use", Open Source DNS solutions like BIND
do not have native GUIs or robust API integrations,plus deploying and maintaining such a solution across
your infrastructure is generally a complex process that is fraught with difficulty. But DNS like NS1 features
a simple and powerful single pane of glass user interface through which you can manage traffic across your
entire infrastructure. It is built atop a clean and fully-featured RESTful API that speaks JSON to ensure
seamless integration.
