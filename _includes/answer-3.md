### What did you think of our service during the time you used it?

The ``deploy to Netlify`` link action from the staticgen site was quick. 
I initially had issues with the admin UI, but on second thought, the UI is clean, 
clear and simple. Everything is easy to find and navigate. Offline, the UI still works 
(thanks to SPA) except for some widgets that load their data on demand.
