### Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?

First of all, the job post is perfect nothing to change there. In fact, after reading the
job post the first time I came across it, I was encouraged to apply. But I am not comfortable
posting answers to the next steps questions in public. The idea of using Netlify to publish
a live site is good, but the test could have been to build a live site with so and so feature or
maybe provide a repo of a broken site on Github and ask the candidate to fix it as part of the technical
support challenge or something similar. Overall the exercise was fun, thanks.
