###  Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.  

The [Stripe API Reference](https://stripe.com/docs/api) does a fantastic job of copy-paste ready 
sample API calls. Each example request includes the proper cURL parameters, an API key, as well 
as any identifiers needed for a successful API call. The most impressive part is that you donâ€™t 
need to be logged in, or even have an account, to have a successful API call. Stripe creates a 
unique API key for every visitor to its documentation, providing the ultimate low-friction path 
to sample calls.
