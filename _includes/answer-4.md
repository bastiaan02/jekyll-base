*Question 4:* Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.
Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.  

I had no challenge setting up the site, I chose jekyll because it's a ruby gem and I am 
comfortable working with gems. I simply used the ``Deploy to netlify`` button from the staticgen
site, after the site went live, I just cloned the branch on my local, added my answers and 
pushed to github, netlify then took care of updating the live site.
