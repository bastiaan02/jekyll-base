### Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did. Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.  

I had no challenge setting up the site. I chose Jekyll because it's a ruby gem and I have 
experience working with ruby gems. I used the ``Deploy to Netlify`` link from the staticgen site. 
After the site went live, I cloned the branch on my local, added my answers and pushed to Github, 
Netlify then took care of updating the live site.
